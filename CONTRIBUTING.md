# Contributing to the CRediT Ontology

## new term requests

This ontology is not accepting new term requests.  New terms will only be added to this project if they are first added to [CrediT](https://w3id.org/credit/).  Contributors with suggestions for additional contributor roles should consider making those requests to the [Contributor Role Ontology (CRO)](https://github.com/data2health/contributor-role-ontology/issues) instead.  The CRO is semantically aligned with CRediT and aims to provide an expanded set of contributor roles, integration with various vocabularies and upper ontologies that include Role concepts, and discipline-specific subsets of the larger set of roles.


## modeling requests within the scope of CRediT

Requests that are within the scope of CRediT will be considered.  For example, CRediT's implementation instructions describe an optional "degree of contribution" that is not explicitly defined in the [original taxonomy](https://w3id.org/credit/taxonomy) but which [seems appropriate to model in the ontology implementation](https://github.com/data2health/credit-ontology/issues/2).  Any similar suggestions are welcome.


## annotation updates

Corrections, updates, and additions to term annotations are welcome.  


## making suggestions
